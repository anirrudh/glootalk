### Examples

These following examples are samples of how to utilize and build with PyO3. 

[] Rewrite shell file for conda python binary 
[] Investigate nix env with Chris

### py-rs 

Call rust from python

### rs-py

### Notes

`cargo` is automatically distributed with rustc. This means that as long as we install the `rust` package from conda-forge, we should be good.
